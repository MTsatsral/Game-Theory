Name of the Strategy: Strategy
Initial State: 0

Strategy: 
0: C, 1, 4
1: C, 2, 4
2: C, 3, 4
3: D, 0, 4
4: D, 0, 4

Motivation:
Since there will be a lot of rounds, consistent cooperation seems to be the best strategy. However, we want to implement a winning strategy and every once in a while defect after creating trust by cooperating for 3 rounds. 

After this defection we go back to our circle of cooperation and hope to create trust again with our opponent. 

If our opponent defects just once, we will defect until our opponent cooperates again, bringing us back to our circle of trust. 

This means we have a hopefully winning strategy against people who always cooperate by creating trust between us, and don't lose by a big margin against people who often defect.
